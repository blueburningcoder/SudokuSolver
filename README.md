# SudokuSolver
out-of-fun try of a sudoku-solver and creator

Should be able to create as well as solve Sudokus when finished.

Currently there's two versions, one in C++ and one in Rust (which is better already). The Rust version can not yet generate sudokus. Also there's no buttons to toggle the autosolving-property.
