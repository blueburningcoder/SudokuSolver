# SudokuSolver
C++: \<unknown\>
  
Rust: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fkarg/SudokuSolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fkarg/SudokuSolver)

out-of-fun try of a sudoku-solver and creator

Should be able to create as well as solve Sudokus when finished.

Currently there's two versions, one in C++ and one in Rust (which is way better). The Rust version can not yet generate sudokus. Also there's no buttons to toggle the autosolving-property. It can be controlled using buttons instead.
